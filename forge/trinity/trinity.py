class Trinity(Timed):
   '''Pantheon-God-Sword (Cluster-Server-Core) wrapper

   Trinity is a featherweight wrapper around the
   excellent Ray API that provides a simple interface
   for generic, persistent, and asynchronous computation
   at the Cluster, Server, and Core levels. It also
   provides builtin performance logging and does not
   interfere with pdb breakpoint debugging.

   To use Trinity, override Pantheon, God, and Sword to
   specify Cluster, Server, and Core level execution.
   Overriding the step() function allows you to perform
   arbitrary computation and return arbitrary data to
   the previous layer. Calling super.step() allows you
   to send arbitrary data and receive computation results
   from the next layer.

   Args:
      pantheon: A subclassed Pantheon object
      god: A subclassed God object
      Sword: A subclassed Sword object

   Notes:
      Trinity is not a single computation model. It is an
      interface for creating computation models. By
      example, our demo project adopts a computation
      model similar to OpenAI Rapid. But trinity makes it
      possible to move any piece of the execution among
      hardware layers with relatively little code and testing.
